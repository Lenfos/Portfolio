  "description" : "Ziggy found life (but ran out of fuel on his way home) is a vertical slice made at UQAC in a team with several Montreal artists. In this project, I had the opportunity to work as a developer and Firefighter.\n\nThis game is a game of planet exploration in third-person view. You play as Ziggy, a clumsy astronaut who, after discovering extraterrestrial life, must now find fuel to return to his spaceship and announce his great discovery.\n",
