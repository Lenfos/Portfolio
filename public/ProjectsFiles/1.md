***Mad Space*** is a **video game** created in November 2024 as part of UQAC's Autumn 2024 Wonder Jam. The theme of the Jam was ‘Dimension’ and three styles had to be respected by each team. Our styles were:

 1. Maniac
 2. Collector
 3. In the stars

Our team consisted of four people, and I served as the Game/Level Designer.

The game takes place in an abandoned ship where the main character moves around trying to collect as much treasure as possible. Our character is a wreck looter, so he is counting on this ship to finally become rich. Unfortunately for him, the ship is infested with a strange disease that drives him mad as long as he remains in the dark. His goal? To find all the treasures hidden in the ship while trying not to go mad. To do this, he can use the few remaining lights on the ship to calm his madness. He also has a torch that he can use as he pleases to find his way around, but be careful because the battery runs out very quickly. If he wants, he can try to find batteries along the way to power his torch, but be careful, don't forget the return journey...

Mad Space was therefore created in two days for the Game Jam. Due to the time constraints and the lack of artists in our team (which consisted solely of developers), we decided to use assets available on [Fab.com](https://fab.com).

*The complete list of assets is available on the [itch page](https://lenfos.itch.io/mad-space).*

Furthermore, given the nature of the competition and despite having a team made up entirely of developers, the game was created entirely in Blueprint in order to be more efficient quickly.

This Game Jam taught me a lot, both as a level designer and in terms of managing crises that arise during the short development time of a game. I think Mad Space is the game jam game I'm most proud of so far. It was an indescribable experience that I would gladly repeat, and I would like to thank my team, with whom I worked over the weekend.
