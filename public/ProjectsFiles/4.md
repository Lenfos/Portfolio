# Ziggy Found life (but ran out of fuel on his way home)

[Link to Post-Mortem of the project](/ProjectsFiles/PostMortemZiggy.pdf)

***--Ziggy Found Life*** is a **video game** developed as part of a course at UQAC. This course is special because it brought together developers from my campus (Chicoutimi) and artists from the Montreal campus (UQAC-NAD). The goal was to develop a **Vertical Slice** for a game chosen in advance during the prototype development phase.

## Game Overview

Ziggy Found Life (But Ran Out of Fuel on His Way Home) is a third-person planet exploration game. You play as Ziggy, a clumsy astronaut who, after discovering extraterrestrial life, must now find fuel to return to his spaceship and announce his great discovery.

To achieve this, Ziggy will have to manoeuvre a long petrol pipe through various obstacles, always looking for the most direct route. Be careful: if the pipe reaches its maximum length, Ziggy risks getting stuck forever!

Ziggy Found Life was a project that proved very difficult to carry out from a communication standpoint. Numerous problems arose between the developers and artists. With just a few days to go before the project's final deadline, I wanted to restore this lost communication, and we were able to resume the final sprint for the project with much greater ease.

This project taught me a great deal, both from a technical standpoint, with the creation of new mechanics and the implementation of builds that I had never done before, but above all from a communication and crisis management standpoint.
A week before the final deadline, I was given the role of Firefighter to take care of all the upcoming builds of the game. In reality, since I had re-established communication with the artists, I spent more time debugging the game and sending reminders to the other developers.

Despite the various difficulties we encountered, I really enjoyed working on this project with the artists.
