# SIDERA

***SIDERA*** is a **One Pager** created as part of a Game Design course at UQAC. The aim of this project was to show us how to create a One Pager for a video game that we had to imagine. The aim of this exercise is to teach us how to create this type of document, which is becoming increasingly common in the industry.

Our teacher (a professional game designer) gave us free rein to design our game. This exercise took the form of a competition, and all the entries were judged by a group of industry professionals to select the six best games.

--- 
The One Pager's rating criteria were as follows:

 - Compliance with instructions
- Understanding the context of video game development
- Presentation of the Persona
- Clarity of the 3Cs
- Presentation of Design Intentions
- Analysis of the competition
- Overall quality of the One Pager
- Originality of the Concept
- Quality of the presentation
- Quality of the French

## Story and Gameplay

The game is an ode to space exploration in the style of Outer Wilds. It is primarily a narrative adventure that emphasises adulthood and forgetting the simple things in life and the innocence we lose as we grow up. SIDERA features a man and a child whom he meets in a park and whom he ends up following in order to find his friend, a stuffed animal.
The goal is to play on unrealistic events reminiscent of a child's imagination.


## Results

Unfortunately, the game was not selected because the committee felt that the document lacked clarity regarding gameplay and therefore they could not visualise the experience I was trying to create. In addition, they would have liked more details about the puzzles featured in the game.


I particularly enjoyed working on this project, which, in the form of a competition, provided additional motivation to come up with an interesting game.
