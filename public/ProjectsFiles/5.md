***Flesh-Hunt*** is a **2D platform game** created in 2024 as part of SpeedJam #6. This Game Jam stood out for its format, which encouraged the development of a game for speedrunners. Our team of four rose to the challenge by creating a technical platform in Godot based on a **try and retry** system that allowed speedrunners to quickly improve their times.

## Gameplay and story

In Flesh Hunt, the player takes on the role of a skeleton lost in the desert who must find the different parts of his body scattered throughout the environment.

The objective is to find one of the two exits in the game and finish it with as many points as possible as quickly as possible. Collecting the different parts of his body is not mandatory but increases the final score.

Several mechanics were added during this jam, such as throwing bones to quickly recover different parts of your body, or wall jumps, which are essential for certain parts of the map.

In this project, I worked mainly as a level designer, as I designed and created the entire game map. However, I also helped out as a developer, mainly on mechanics related to the environment, such as quicksand and lightning.

We signed up for this Game Jam two weeks after starting game development, so this project was the perfect introduction to discovering the entire game development process, from concept to final build.
