# Eclipse Arena

***Eclipse Arena*** is an **online multiplayer game** project developed at UQAC as part of a specialised course in multiplayer development. This course taught us the technical fundamentals of multiplayer gaming using Unreal Engine, challenging us to overcome issues such as synchronisation and network latency.

## Concept of the game

Eclipse Arena is a multiplayer combat arena where two players battle it out in a spaceship. The gameplay focuses on shooting, requiring good synchronisation between clients to ensure a smooth and fair gaming experience.

## Technical challenges addressed

This project allowed me to master the fundamental aspects of multiplayer development in Unreal Engine:

- **Server Travel**: Managing transitions between maps while maintaining player connections
- **Server Rewind**: Implementing a lag compensation system to manage latency differences between players
- **RPC (Remote Procedure Calls)**: Bidirectional communication between the server and clients to synchronise actions
- **Time synchronisation**: Management of network time to ensure consistency of events between all players
- And much more...

Eclipse Arena confronted me with the real complexities of online multiplayer gaming. In particular, I learned how to handle client-side predictions, server reconciliation, and bandwidth optimisation. These concepts, which are often abstract in theory, became concrete through practical implementation.
  
This project was an excellent introduction to online multiplayer development and gave me a solid foundation to continue with online development.
